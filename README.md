# Minetest Floppies
This mod adds throwable floppies to Minetest... That's what they're used for right?

The floppies can be crafted with 7 wool nodes in a H-shape, a steel/iron ingot at the top and paper at the bottom. Red, green and blue floppies exist, craftable with the equivalent wool in Minetest Game.
